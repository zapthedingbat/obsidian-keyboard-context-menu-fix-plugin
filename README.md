## Obsidian plugin that fixes keyboard navigation of spelling suggestion context menu.

This is a plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md).

While Obsidian is a good note taking application, it's still under active development and some features are still a little buggy. This includes much of the keyboard navigation functionality.

If you're used to writing quickly on a keyboard, breaking away from the keyboard to use the mouse can be disruptive. My typing and spelling is far from perfect so I rely heavily on spellcheck to correct errors as I go. Unfortunately Obsidian's spellchecking suggestions are only available through a mouse interaction (right click)

Obsidian is a closed source project so I wasn't able to contribute to fix this, instead I've written this plugin to work around the limitation until the keyboard navigation features have been fixed.
